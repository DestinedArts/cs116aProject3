3D object with parent and children: pyramid and cone, box not acceptable unless with color

Rotating parent will affect children with the coordinate space having been changed when dragging or rotating the children since their local spaces have also gone through the transformations.

### TO-DO:
insert joints function<br>
Delete root, leave children as orphans; but then have to add back functionality to orphans. Technically should delete whole skeleton.
